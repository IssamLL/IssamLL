### About Me
I'am Issam ECH-CHAOUI, a Data Scientist and a Master of Engineering student at INSEA, I am passionate about applying data science to solve real-world problems and create value for businesses and society.

During my internships at AttijariWafa Bank and the Ministry of Agriculture, I worked on projects involving data analysis, machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision, using Python and various frameworks and tools. I developed models for predicting energy consumption, generating advertising slogans in Darija, and detecting crop diseases, among others.

I have also completed multiple online courses and certifications, and participated in hackathons and competitions, to enhance my skills and knowledge in data science. I have a keen interest in deep learning techniques and their applications in various domains, such as NLP and CV.

I am always eager to learn new things, collaborate with others, and contribute to the data science community. I am looking for a data science PFE that will challenge me, allow me to grow, and make a positive impact.
